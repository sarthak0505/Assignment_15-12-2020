# Assignment (Solved these frontend questions using Angular)
Q1. Find the missing number in the series:  
2,3,10,15,26,35,50,63,?  
Implement the solution within Angular in which, a text box is given along with a button.  User can enter any index of the series and at the button click; the page should display the number  at that entered index.

Q2. Make a form having 
∙ A input for phone number, 
∙ A button to add another number labelled "Add another phone number" ∙ A submit button

If  the number of input fields for phone number is greater than 1 then, consider adding delete  buttons to each input field. 
The "Submit" button should log an array to the console having all the phone numbers in a format  shown below : 
[ 
{phoneNumber1: **value form 1st field**}, 
{phoneNumber2: **value form 2nd field**}, 
{phoneNumber3: **value form 3rd field**},
